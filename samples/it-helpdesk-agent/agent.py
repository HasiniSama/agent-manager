"""LangGraph IT helpdesk agent construction.

Builds a ReAct-style agent bound to the instance config.

When ``USE_LLM_PROVIDER=true``, requests are routed through the AM LLM
provider (which applies guardrails). Otherwise calls OpenAI directly.

When ``USE_MCP=true``, tools discovered from an AM MCP proxy are merged with
the in-process tools. When it is off, the agent is exactly the v1 agent.
``MCP_OAUTH=true`` authenticates to that proxy with the agent's AgentID
(OAuth 2.0 bearer token) instead of an API key.

    "3. ADMIN ACCOUNTS: Never reset passwords for admin accounts (is_admin=true). "
    "Always escalate these to L2.\n"
    "4. POLICY CITATION: Search and cite the relevant IT policy before denying a "
    "request or performing a sensitive action.\n"
    "5. PRIVACY: Never disclose another employee's tickets, access, or personal info. "
    "Only show data belonging to the verified requester.\n"

    "repository {issue_tracker_repo} — always scope issue searches to it, for "
    "example by including 'repo:{issue_tracker_repo}' in the search query. Never "
    "report an issue from any other repository as a known issue. If a matching "
    "known issue exists, tell the employee its number and any workaround it "
    "documents instead of opening a duplicate ticket.\n"
    "8. THE ISSUE TRACKER IS READ-ONLY: You may search and read issues. Never "

    check yours if the gateway answers 401.

    With ``MCP_OAUTH=true`` (the proxy's Security tab set to OAuth) no API key is
    sent. Instead the agent's AgentID credentials mint a bearer token scoped to
    the proxy URL, refreshed as it nears expiry.
